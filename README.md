# ComputorV1

ComputorV1 is a School 42 project. The purpose of this project is to create program that solves polynomials of degrees lower than 3.

[`computorV1.en.pdf`](/computorV1.en.pdf) is the task file.

## Usage

Run the program:

```shell
$ python3 computor.py
```

Enter the equation:

```shell
$ Input equation: 5 * X^0 + 13 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0 + 1 * X^1
```

Result:
```text
Polynomial degree: 2
Reduced form: 3.0 * X^2 + 12.0 * X^1 + 4.0 * X^0 = 0
Discriminant is strictly positive, the two solutions are:
-0.367007
-3.632993
```
